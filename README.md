## Overview

LEO is a high-performance password recovery tool designed for ethical penetration testing and security research. Features 27 hash algorithms, multi-core processing, and intelligent attack strategies for authorized security assessments.

### Key Features

* **Multi-Core Processing** - Automatic CPU optimization
* **27 Hash Algorithms** - MD5, SHA family, BLAKE2, NTLM, and more
* **3 Attack Methods** - Dictionary, Brute-force, Hybrid
* **Real-Time Stats** - Live hash rate and progress monitoring
* **Professional Grade** - Built for real-world pentesting

## Quick Start

```bash
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/NightmareLynx/LEO.git
cd LEO

# Optional dependencies
pip install pycryptodome bcrypt argon2-cffi

# Run
python3 LEO.py
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Launch tool and enable multi-core processing
2. Select attack method (Dictionary/Brute-force/Hybrid)
3. Choose hash algorithm (1-27)
4. Enter target hash
5. Configure attack parameters

### Example: Dictionary Attack

```bash
Select attack method: 1
Select algorithm (1-27): 1  # MD5
Enter target hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
Enter wordlist path: rockyou.txt
```

## Attack Methods

### 1. Dictionary Attack

Fast wordlist-based cracking with multi-core support. Best for common passwords.

**Usage**: Provide wordlist path (e.g., rockyou.txt)

### 2. Brute-Force Attack

Comprehensive character combination testing. Best for short passwords.

**Options**:

* Length range (1-4 recommended for speed)
* Character sets: lowercase, uppercase, digits, alphanumeric, symbols

### 3. Hybrid Attack

Intelligent mutations combining wordlist + transformations.

**Mutations**: capitalize, reverse, leet speak, numbers, years, symbols, doubles, common patterns

## Performance


| Algorithm | Hash Rate\* | Use Case       |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| MD5       | 1M+ h/s     | Legacy systems |
| SHA1      | 800K+ h/s   | Git, legacy    |
| SHA256    | 400K+ h/s   | Modern systems |
| NTLM      | 900K+ h/s   | Windows auth   |

\*Approximate rates - varies by CPU/cores

### Optimization Tips

* Enable multi-core processing (always)
* Use SSD for wordlist storage
* Choose faster algorithms when possible
* Remove duplicate wordlist entries
